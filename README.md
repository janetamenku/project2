Project Name: DynamoDB Creation using Terraform
 
Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to create a DynamoDB table on AWS. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) installed on your local machine.
- AWS credentials configured on your local machine. You can set this up using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with the `aws configure` command.

Setup Instructions
Step 1: Install Terraform
Follow the installation guide for your operating system to install Terraform: [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials
Set up your AWS credentials on your local machine using the AWS CLI:
Type aws configure and configure it appropriately with your credentials

Step 3: Create a Terraform Directory
Create a new directory on your local machine where you will store your Terraform configuration files:
mkdir terraform-dynamodb
cd terraform-dynamodb

Step 4: Create a Terraform Configuration File
Create a new file in your Terraform directory called `main.tf`. This file will contain the configuration for your DynamoDB table.
 
Step 5: Define the AWS Provider
In your `main.tf` file, define your AWS provider. This tells Terraform which AWS region to use and which AWS credentials to use.

Step 6: Define the DynamoDB Table
To create a DynamoDB table, define the attributes and settings such as name, hash key, range key, read capacity, write capacity, etc. Add the following code to your `main.tf` file:

Step 7: Initialize Terraform
Initialize the working directory and download the required plugins:
Run “terraform init”

Step 8: Preview Changes
Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes that will be made

Step 9: Apply Changes
Run `terraform apply` to create the DynamoDB table:

10. Conclusion
By following these steps, you will successfully create a DynamoDB table using Terraform. This setup provides a scalable and manageable way to configure your DynamoDB resources.
